# Pig Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Pig Game! This is a fun and interactive web-based game where players take turns rolling dice and racking up points. The goal? Be the first to reach a set score! This project was a fantastic opportunity for me to level up my JavaScript skills and deepen my understanding of web development concepts.

## Features

- **Two Player Mode**: Challenge a friend or play solo!
- **Dice Roll Simulation**: Roll the dice to accumulate points, but be careful you could lose them too!
- **Score Tracking**: Keep tabs on each player’s score throughout the game.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enjoy an intuitive design that makes navigation and gameplay a breeze.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Key Learnings

Throughout the development of the Pig Game, I focused on several areas that really helped me grow:

1. **JavaScript Skills**: 
   - I gained a deeper understanding of core JavaScript concepts, like variables, functions, and event handling.
   
2. **DOM Management**: 
   - I learned how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the game interface based on user interactions, such as displaying scores and changing game states.
   
3. **Refactoring Code**: 
   - I improved the structure and readability of my code by refactoring, breaking complex functions into smaller, reusable components to make everything more maintainable.

4. **Game Logic Implementation**: 
   - I developed a solid grasp of game mechanics by implementing rules and logic to manage player turns, scoring, and resets.

5. **Responsive Design**: 
   - I applied CSS techniques to ensure the game looks great and functions well across different devices.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.
3. Accumulate points or choose to hold your score to save your points.
4. The first player to reach the target score wins the game!

## Future Improvements

- Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Add animations and sound effects for a more engaging experience.
- Create a mobile version of the game for better accessibility.

## Conclusion

Building the Pig Game was an exciting journey that allowed me to apply and expand my JavaScript skills. I can’t wait to continue learning and tackling new challenges in the world of web development.
